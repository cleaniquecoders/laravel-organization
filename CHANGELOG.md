# Changelog

All notable changes to `laravel-organization` will be documented in this file.

## 1.2.2 - 2026-01-02

### New Features

#### Organization Ownership Transfer

A complete workflow for transferring organization ownership between users has been implemented.

**How it works:**

1. The current owner initiates a transfer request from the organization's action menu
2. The new owner receives an email notification with Accept/Decline links
3. The new owner reviews and accepts or declines the request
4. If accepted, ownership transfers and the previous owner becomes an Administrator

### New Files Added

#### Models

- `src/Models/OwnershipTransferRequest.php` - Model for managing transfer requests with statuses (pending, accepted, declined, cancelled)

#### Actions

- `src/Actions/AcceptOwnershipTransfer.php` - Accepts transfer and updates ownership
- `src/Actions/DeclineOwnershipTransfer.php` - Declines transfer request
- `src/Actions/CancelOwnershipTransfer.php` - Cancels pending transfer request

#### Events

- `src/Events/OwnershipTransferRequested.php`
- `src/Events/OwnershipTransferAccepted.php`
- `src/Events/OwnershipTransferDeclined.php`
- `src/Events/OwnershipTransferCancelled.php`

#### Mail

#### Views

- `resources/views/emails/ownership-transfer-request.blade.php` - Transfer request email template
- `resources/views/emails/ownership-transfer-completed.blade.php` - Transfer completed email template
- `resources/views/livewire/transfer-ownership.blade.php` - Transfer ownership form
- `resources/views/transfer-ownership.blade.php` - Standalone transfer page

#### Routes

- `routes/web.php` - Package routes for transfer functionality:
  - `GET /organization/{organization}/transfer` - Transfer ownership page
  - `GET /organization/transfer/{token}/accept` - Accept transfer via email
  - `GET /organization/transfer/{token}/decline` - Decline transfer via email
  

#### Migrations

- `database/migrations/create_ownership_transfer_requests_table.php.stub`

### Changes

#### OrganizationRole Enum

- Added `OWNER` role case
- Added `isOwner()` method
- Updated `label()` and `description()` methods

#### Organization Model

- Added `owners()` relationship for pivot table
- Updated `transferOwnership()` method to handle role changes in pivot table

#### InteractsWithUserOrganization Trait

- Added `ownedOrganizationsViaRole()` method
- Added `isOwnerOf()` method

#### CreateNewOrganization Action

- Creator is now assigned `OWNER` role (instead of `ADMINISTRATOR`) in the pivot table

#### Livewire Components

- Added `TransferOwnership` component for initiating transfers
- Updated `OrganizationList` component with 3-dot dropdown menu and Transfer Ownership action
- Fixed `OrganizationSwitcher` component for Livewire 3 single root element requirement

#### UI Improvements

- Added 3-dot dropdown action menu for organization list
- Dropdown menu now uses fixed positioning to prevent overflow clipping
- Removed duplicate Alpine.js CDN (Livewire 3 includes Alpine)

### Database Schema

New `ownership_transfer_requests` table:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | bigint | Primary key |
| uuid | string | Unique identifier |
| organization_id | bigint | Foreign key to organizations |
| current_owner_id | bigint | Foreign key to users (current owner) |
| new_owner_id | bigint | Foreign key to users (new owner) |
| token | string | Unique token for email links |
| message | text | Optional message from current owner |
| expires_at | timestamp | Request expiration time |
| accepted_at | timestamp | When request was accepted |
| declined_at | timestamp | When request was declined |
| cancelled_at | timestamp | When request was cancelled |
| created_at | timestamp | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | timestamp | Last update timestamp |

### Configuration

The transfer request expiration time defaults to 72 hours and can be customized via the `InitiateOwnershipTransfer` action.

### Breaking Changes

- Organizations now use dual-record ownership: `owner_id` column AND pivot table entry with `OWNER` role
- Default role when creating organization changed from `ADMINISTRATOR` to `OWNER`

## 1.2.1 - 2026-01-01

### Overview

This release includes critical security fixes, performance improvements, and code quality enhancements for the Laravel Organization package.


---

### Security Fixes

**Authorization Checks for Invitations**

- SendInvitation: Added permission validation to ensure only organization owners or active members can send invitations
- ResendInvitation: Added permission validation to prevent unauthorized users from resending invitations

**Database Transaction for AcceptInvitation**

- Wrapped invitation acceptance and user addition in a database transaction to ensure atomic operations and prevent data inconsistencies


---

### Bug Fixes

**Email Membership Check**

- Fixed critical bug in SendInvitation where the email membership check was querying the pivot table (which doesn't have an email column) instead of joining with the users table


---

### Performance Improvements

**N+1 Query Fixes**

- OrganizationList: Added eager loading for user memberships to prevent N+1 queries when displaying user roles
- InvitationManager: Added eager loading for invitedByUser and organization relationships


---

### Code Quality Improvements

**Centralized Session Management**

- Introduced LaravelOrganization utility class with centralized SESSION_KEY constant and helper methods:
  - getCurrentOrganizationId()
  - setCurrentOrganizationId()
  - clearSession()
  

**Consistent Exception Types**

- Standardized exception types across action classes to use InvalidArgumentException consistently

**Type Safety**

- Added return type hints to model methods (getId(), getOwnerId(), getAcceptedAt(), etc.)
- Added parameter type hints to Livewire component methods
- Updated contracts with proper type declarations

**Enum Usage**

- Replaced hardcoded role strings with OrganizationRole enum values


---

### Breaking Changes

**Authorization Requirements**

- SendInvitation::handle() now requires the inviter to be an organization owner or active member
- ResendInvitation::handle() now requires an authenticated user with permission to manage the organization's invitations


---

### Files Changed

- `src/LaravelOrganization.php` - New utility class
- `src/Actions/SendInvitation.php` - Authorization check + email membership fix
- `src/Actions/AcceptInvitation.php` - Database transaction

- `src/Contracts/UserOrganizationContract.php` - Type declarations


---

### Upgrade Guide

1. Update any custom code that calls `SendInvitation::handle()` to ensure the inviter is the organization owner or an active member
2. Update any custom code that calls `ResendInvitation::handle()` to pass an authenticated user as the second parameter
3. If you were referencing the session key directly, migrate to using `LaravelOrganization::SESSION_KEY`

## Authorization, Events, Hardening & CI Expansion  - 2025-11-11

### Summary

This release focuses on platform hardening: a comprehensive `OrganizationPolicy`, a full organization lifecycle event suite, stricter validation and error handling in Livewire components, configurable rate limiting for organization creation, zero PHPStan issues (Level 5), expanded multi-version / multi-OS CI matrix, and integrated test coverage reporting. No breaking changes.

### Added

- Authorization layer: `OrganizationPolicy` (11 discrete abilities: viewAny, view, create, update, delete, restore, forceDelete, manageMembers, changeMemberRole, transferOwnership, manageSettings).
  
- Organization lifecycle events:
  
  - `OrganizationCreated`, `OrganizationUpdated`, `OrganizationDeleted`
  - Membership events: `MemberAdded`, `MemberRemoved`, `MemberRoleChanged`
  - Ownership transfer: `OwnershipTransferred`
  
- Invitation event listener wiring groundwork (listener registration for future invitation features without exposing unfinished API).
  
- Invitation Management
  
- Rate limiting for organization creation (configurable in `config/organization.php`).
  
- Expanded CI matrix:
  
  - PHP 8.3 & 8.4
  - Laravel 11 & 12
  - Ubuntu, macOS, Windows runners
  
- Test coverage generation & reporting (HTML + external service badge integration).
  
- Robust validation and structured exception handling in Livewire components (`CreateOrganization`, `UpdateOrganization`, `OrganizationSwitcher`, `OrganizationList`).

**Invitation Management**
`<livewire:org::invitation-manager :organization="$organization" />` provides send, resend, accept/decline UI with notifications.
Core methods:

```php
sendInvitation();
resendInvitation($uuid);
acceptInvitation($uuid);
declineInvitation($uuid);



```
### Changed

- Service provider (`LaravelOrganizationServiceProvider`) now:
  
  - Registers `OrganizationPolicy` via Gate.
  - Registers event listeners (`InvitationSent` → `SendInvitationEmail`) for future extensibility.
  - Registers additional Livewire components including `invitation-manager` scaffold.
  
- Improved internal consistency of role handling via `OrganizationRole` enum throughout actions and tests.
  
- Documentation expanded for policies, events, and configuration options (authorization & lifecycle usage examples).
  

### Fixed

- Eliminated all PHPStan Level 5 errors (49 → 0) through:
  
  - PHPDoc enrichment
  - Correct builder & relationship typing
  - Removal of unused variables and dead code
  
- Defensive guards added in Livewire components to prevent unhandled exceptions when edge conditions occur.
  
- Stable organization scoping (recursion fix retained; no regressions observed).
  

### Quality / DX

- > 250 tests total (policy + event suites substantially increased coverage).
  
- Architecture tests ensure no debug functions (`dump`, `dd`, `ray`) leak into release code.
  
- Consistent contract bindings for `OrganizationContract`, `OrganizationMembershipContract`, `OrganizationOwnershipContract`, `OrganizationSettingsContract`.
  

### Performance & Safety

- Rate limiting prevents abuse of organization creation (default: 5/hour per user; tune via config).
- Event-driven architecture enables deferred processing (queue-ready serialization in events).

### Documentation

- Policy usage guide: how to integrate with `Gate::allows()` and blade `@can` directives.
- Event dispatch examples: hooking into organization lifecycle for auditing or notifications.
- Configuration reference updated to include rate limiting keys.

### Upgrade Notes

- No breaking changes.
- Optional: publish updated config if you want rate limiting.
  ```bash
  php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-organization-config"
  
  
  
  ```
- If you already extended your own policy, ensure merging the newly added abilities.
- To leverage events, register listeners in your app (audit logging, notifications, etc.).

### Suggested Post-Upgrade Checks

- Run static analysis: `composer analyse`
- Run tests: `composer test`
- (Optional) Generate coverage report: `composer test-coverage`

### Compare

https://github.com/cleaniquecoders/laravel-organization/compare/1.1.2...1.2.0

### Installation (unchanged)

```bash
composer require cleaniquecoders/laravel-organization
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-organization-migrations"
php artisan migrate



```
### Snippets

Policy check:

```php
if (Gate::allows('update', $organization)) {
    // proceed
}



```
Listening to an event:

```php
Event::listen(\CleaniqueCoders\LaravelOrganization\Events\OrganizationCreated::class, function ($event) {
    // custom audit log
});



```
Rate limit config fragment (`config/organization.php`):

```php
'rate_limits' => [
    'organization_creation' => [
        'max' => 5,
        'decay_minutes' => 60,
    ],
],



```
## Fixed Recursion - 2025-10-10

### Memory Exhaustion Fix - Infinite Loop Prevention

#### Problem Description

When users registered and received email verification, the application would hang and eventually hit PHP's memory limit with errors like:

```
PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 2147483648 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 12288 bytes)
in vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/SoftDeletingScope.php on line 121




```
#### Root Cause

The issue was caused by a **circular reference/infinite loop** in the organization scoping mechanism:

1. `OrganizationScope::apply()` is called when querying models with `InteractsWithOrganization` trait
2. The scope accessed `Auth::user()->organization_id`
3. Accessing `->organization_id` as a property triggers Laravel's attribute accessor
4. If the User model has a `currentOrganization()` relationship, this might load the Organization model
5. The Organization model may have relationships to other models that use `InteractsWithOrganization`
6. Those models apply `OrganizationScope` again...
7. **Back to step 1 - infinite loop!**

##### Why It Happened During Registration/Verification

During registration and email verification:

- The user is authenticated
- Multiple queries are executed (user lookup, email verification, redirects)
- Each query on scoped models triggers the scope
- The scope accesses the user model repeatedly
- This creates an exponential cascade of queries

#### The Fix

##### Changed Files

1. **`src/Scopes/OrganizationScope.php`**
2. **`src/Concerns/InteractsWithOrganization.php`**

##### Solution Approach

Instead of accessing `Auth::user()->organization_id` (which can trigger relationships and accessors), we now:

1. **Access raw attributes directly** from the model's `attributes` property
2. **Bypass relationship loading** and any getters/accessors
3. **Prevent recursive scope application**

##### Code Changes

###### Before (Problematic):

```php
public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model)
{
    if (Auth::check() && Auth::user()->organization_id) {
        $builder->where('organization_id', Auth::user()->organization_id);
    }
}




```
###### After (Fixed):

```php
public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model)
{
    $organizationId = $this->getCurrentOrganizationId();

    if ($organizationId) {
        $builder->where('organization_id', $organizationId);
    }
}

protected function getCurrentOrganizationId(): ?int
{
    if (! Auth::check()) {
        return null;
    }

    $user = Auth::user();

    // Access the raw attribute directly to prevent triggering relationships
    if ($user && property_exists($user, 'attributes') && isset($user->attributes['organization_id'])) {
        return $user->attributes['organization_id'];
    }

    return null;
}




```
##### Key Technical Details

1. **Direct Attribute Access**: `$user->attributes['organization_id']` accesses the raw database column value
2. **No Magic Methods**: Bypasses `__get()`, accessors, and relationship loading
3. **Safe Property Check**: Uses `property_exists()` to ensure the attributes array exists
4. **Null Safety**: Gracefully handles null organization_id and unauthenticated users

#### Testing

A comprehensive test suite was added in `tests/OrganizationScopeRecursionTest.php` to verify:

1. No infinite recursion when accessing organization relationships
2. Safe retrieval of organization_id without triggering relationships
3. Graceful handling of null organization_id
4. Proper behavior when user is not authenticated

#### Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Never access relationships in global scopes** - always access raw attributes
2. **Be cautious with `Auth::user()` properties** - they may trigger lazy loading
3. **Test with authentication flows** - registration, verification, password reset
4. **Monitor query counts** - excessive queries may indicate recursion
5. **Use Laravel Debugbar or Telescope** during development to catch query loops early

#### Impact

This fix resolves:

- ✅ Memory exhaustion during registration
- ✅ Hanging requests during email verification
- ✅ Infinite loops in organization-scoped queries
- ✅ Performance issues from recursive query execution

#### Compatibility

- **Laravel**: 11.x, 12.x
- **PHP**: 8.3, 8.4
- **Breaking Changes**: None - this is a bug fix with no API changes
