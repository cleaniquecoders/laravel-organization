# Changelog

All notable changes to `laravel-organization` will be documented in this file.

## Authorization, Events, Hardening & CI Expansion  - 2025-11-11

### Summary

This release focuses on platform hardening: a comprehensive `OrganizationPolicy`, a full organization lifecycle event suite, stricter validation and error handling in Livewire components, configurable rate limiting for organization creation, zero PHPStan issues (Level 5), expanded multi-version / multi-OS CI matrix, and integrated test coverage reporting. No breaking changes.

### Added

- Authorization layer: `OrganizationPolicy` (11 discrete abilities: viewAny, view, create, update, delete, restore, forceDelete, manageMembers, changeMemberRole, transferOwnership, manageSettings).
- Organization lifecycle events:
  - `OrganizationCreated`, `OrganizationUpdated`, `OrganizationDeleted`
  - Membership events: `MemberAdded`, `MemberRemoved`, `MemberRoleChanged`
  - Ownership transfer: `OwnershipTransferred`
  
- Invitation event listener wiring groundwork (listener registration for future invitation features without exposing unfinished API).
- Invitation Management
- Rate limiting for organization creation (configurable in `config/organization.php`).
- Expanded CI matrix:
  - PHP 8.3 & 8.4
  - Laravel 11 & 12
  - Ubuntu, macOS, Windows runners
  
- Test coverage generation & reporting (HTML + external service badge integration).
- Robust validation and structured exception handling in Livewire components (`CreateOrganization`, `UpdateOrganization`, `OrganizationSwitcher`, `OrganizationList`).

**Invitation Management**

`<livewire:org::invitation-manager :organization="$organization" />` provides send, resend, accept/decline UI with notifications.

Core methods:

```php
sendInvitation();
resendInvitation($uuid);
acceptInvitation($uuid);
declineInvitation($uuid);

```
### Changed

- Service provider (`LaravelOrganizationServiceProvider`) now:
  - Registers `OrganizationPolicy` via Gate.
  - Registers event listeners (`InvitationSent` → `SendInvitationEmail`) for future extensibility.
  - Registers additional Livewire components including `invitation-manager` scaffold.
  
- Improved internal consistency of role handling via `OrganizationRole` enum throughout actions and tests.
- Documentation expanded for policies, events, and configuration options (authorization & lifecycle usage examples).

### Fixed

- Eliminated all PHPStan Level 5 errors (49 → 0) through:
  - PHPDoc enrichment
  - Correct builder & relationship typing
  - Removal of unused variables and dead code
  
- Defensive guards added in Livewire components to prevent unhandled exceptions when edge conditions occur.
- Stable organization scoping (recursion fix retained; no regressions observed).

### Quality / DX

- > 250 tests total (policy + event suites substantially increased coverage).
  
- Architecture tests ensure no debug functions (`dump`, `dd`, `ray`) leak into release code.
- Consistent contract bindings for `OrganizationContract`, `OrganizationMembershipContract`, `OrganizationOwnershipContract`, `OrganizationSettingsContract`.

### Performance & Safety

- Rate limiting prevents abuse of organization creation (default: 5/hour per user; tune via config).
- Event-driven architecture enables deferred processing (queue-ready serialization in events).

### Documentation

- Policy usage guide: how to integrate with `Gate::allows()` and blade `@can` directives.
- Event dispatch examples: hooking into organization lifecycle for auditing or notifications.
- Configuration reference updated to include rate limiting keys.

### Upgrade Notes

- No breaking changes.
- Optional: publish updated config if you want rate limiting.
  ```bash
  php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-organization-config"
  
  ```
- If you already extended your own policy, ensure merging the newly added abilities.
- To leverage events, register listeners in your app (audit logging, notifications, etc.).

### Suggested Post-Upgrade Checks

- Run static analysis: `composer analyse`
- Run tests: `composer test`
- (Optional) Generate coverage report: `composer test-coverage`

### Compare

https://github.com/cleaniquecoders/laravel-organization/compare/1.1.2...1.2.0

### Installation (unchanged)

```bash
composer require cleaniquecoders/laravel-organization
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-organization-migrations"
php artisan migrate

```
### Snippets

Policy check:

```php
if (Gate::allows('update', $organization)) {
    // proceed
}

```
Listening to an event:

```php
Event::listen(\CleaniqueCoders\LaravelOrganization\Events\OrganizationCreated::class, function ($event) {
    // custom audit log
});

```
Rate limit config fragment (`config/organization.php`):

```php
'rate_limits' => [
    'organization_creation' => [
        'max' => 5,
        'decay_minutes' => 60,
    ],
],

```
## Fixed Recursion - 2025-10-10

### Memory Exhaustion Fix - Infinite Loop Prevention

#### Problem Description

When users registered and received email verification, the application would hang and eventually hit PHP's memory limit with errors like:

```
PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 2147483648 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 12288 bytes)
in vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/SoftDeletingScope.php on line 121


```
#### Root Cause

The issue was caused by a **circular reference/infinite loop** in the organization scoping mechanism:

1. `OrganizationScope::apply()` is called when querying models with `InteractsWithOrganization` trait
2. The scope accessed `Auth::user()->organization_id`
3. Accessing `->organization_id` as a property triggers Laravel's attribute accessor
4. If the User model has a `currentOrganization()` relationship, this might load the Organization model
5. The Organization model may have relationships to other models that use `InteractsWithOrganization`
6. Those models apply `OrganizationScope` again...
7. **Back to step 1 - infinite loop!**

##### Why It Happened During Registration/Verification

During registration and email verification:

- The user is authenticated
- Multiple queries are executed (user lookup, email verification, redirects)
- Each query on scoped models triggers the scope
- The scope accesses the user model repeatedly
- This creates an exponential cascade of queries

#### The Fix

##### Changed Files

1. **`src/Scopes/OrganizationScope.php`**
2. **`src/Concerns/InteractsWithOrganization.php`**

##### Solution Approach

Instead of accessing `Auth::user()->organization_id` (which can trigger relationships and accessors), we now:

1. **Access raw attributes directly** from the model's `attributes` property
2. **Bypass relationship loading** and any getters/accessors
3. **Prevent recursive scope application**

##### Code Changes

###### Before (Problematic):

```php
public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model)
{
    if (Auth::check() && Auth::user()->organization_id) {
        $builder->where('organization_id', Auth::user()->organization_id);
    }
}


```
###### After (Fixed):

```php
public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model)
{
    $organizationId = $this->getCurrentOrganizationId();

    if ($organizationId) {
        $builder->where('organization_id', $organizationId);
    }
}

protected function getCurrentOrganizationId(): ?int
{
    if (! Auth::check()) {
        return null;
    }

    $user = Auth::user();

    // Access the raw attribute directly to prevent triggering relationships
    if ($user && property_exists($user, 'attributes') && isset($user->attributes['organization_id'])) {
        return $user->attributes['organization_id'];
    }

    return null;
}


```
##### Key Technical Details

1. **Direct Attribute Access**: `$user->attributes['organization_id']` accesses the raw database column value
2. **No Magic Methods**: Bypasses `__get()`, accessors, and relationship loading
3. **Safe Property Check**: Uses `property_exists()` to ensure the attributes array exists
4. **Null Safety**: Gracefully handles null organization_id and unauthenticated users

#### Testing

A comprehensive test suite was added in `tests/OrganizationScopeRecursionTest.php` to verify:

1. No infinite recursion when accessing organization relationships
2. Safe retrieval of organization_id without triggering relationships
3. Graceful handling of null organization_id
4. Proper behavior when user is not authenticated

#### Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Never access relationships in global scopes** - always access raw attributes
2. **Be cautious with `Auth::user()` properties** - they may trigger lazy loading
3. **Test with authentication flows** - registration, verification, password reset
4. **Monitor query counts** - excessive queries may indicate recursion
5. **Use Laravel Debugbar or Telescope** during development to catch query loops early

#### Impact

This fix resolves:

- ✅ Memory exhaustion during registration
- ✅ Hanging requests during email verification
- ✅ Infinite loops in organization-scoped queries
- ✅ Performance issues from recursive query execution

#### Compatibility

- **Laravel**: 11.x, 12.x
- **PHP**: 8.3, 8.4
- **Breaking Changes**: None - this is a bug fix with no API changes
